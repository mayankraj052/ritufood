# **App Name**: Ritu AI Cook

## Core Features:

- Recipe Display: Display a curated list of recipes based on the selected season and meal type.
- Seasonal Ingredients: Display list of peak seasonal Indian ingredients, derived from harvest calendar data. These ingredients will not come from a database but rather be delivered directly from the code.
- AI Recipe Suggestion: Users can type queries to Gemini (integrated as a tool) to suggest relevant recipes, constrained by seasonal ingredients and meal preferences.
- Favorites: Enable users to favorite the recipes shown, so that they are available on demand

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saffron (#FF9933) to represent warmth, spice, and the heart of Indian cuisine.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8F8) providing a clean and light backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) as a contrasting color, to suggest freshness and visual interest. 
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for titles and headings, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability. This matches a clean sans-serif with a more fashionable serif font.
- Use simple, line-based icons to represent different ingredients and meal types, ensuring clarity and cultural relevance.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with ample whitespace to ensure content is easily digestible and the app feels modern.
